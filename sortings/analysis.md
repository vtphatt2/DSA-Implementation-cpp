In this article, we will discuss more about the time complexity and space complexity of each sorting algorithm

## Bubble sort and Insertion sort
**Time complexity**
- The average case and the worst case : $O(n^2)$
    -> occurs when the array is reversely sorted.
- The best case : $O(n)$
    -> occurs when the array is already sorted.
**Space complexity** : $O(1)$
